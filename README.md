# LEETCODE Solutions

This repo includes my solutions to Leetcode questions. The questions are solved in Python3 and it does not need any libraries to run.

## Testing

In order to run the tests of the solutions, install [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). 

`pip install -U pytest`

Go to test directory of the selected question and run 

`pytest`

to run all test cases.
